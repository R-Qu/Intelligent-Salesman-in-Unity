# Intelligent-Salesman-in-Unity
In this project, behaviour and interactions between different types of agents and enviroment are implemented on Unity with external Python API for reinforcement learning. Scripts of Agents written in C# are given in this repository. 
### How to use
1. Install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) on your laptop and Download [Intelligent salesman](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X-ujxuTZNs1tK2n6g2PpQPVvguA_ShW5)
2. Unzip the file and Open project 'UnitySDK' on Unity.
3. Follow the instructions in the file **DAI&AI Final project.pdf**
### Reinforcement Learning
It would be really interesting to let agents learn and improve over time. Avoiding other types of agents if theyâ€˜ve had bad experience with them before.
